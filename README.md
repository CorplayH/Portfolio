# Portfolio for every one
This project is based on Laravel and Vue
To use this project, simple migrate the database and you are good to go

The project is designed in the way that each user should have their own Second-level domain, for example:
user A will have own domain: a.example.com
user B will have own domain: b.example.com

each domain will use the same system but the account will be seprated.
